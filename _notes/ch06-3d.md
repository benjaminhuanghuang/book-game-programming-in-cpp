## Transform Matrices for 3D
3D coordinates, the translation matrices become 4*4 matrices

## Roation
in 2D an actor only needed one float for rotation about z-axis

3D, itâ€™s valid to rotate about `any` of the three coordinate axes.

One approach for 3D rotations is Euler angles, where there are three angles (yaw, pitch, and
roll) representing rotation about each axis.

Yaw is a rotation about the up axis, 
pitch is a rotation about the side axis, 
and roll is a rotation about the forward axis.


## Quaternions
quaternion as a method to represent a rotation about an arbitrary axis (not just x, y, or z).
