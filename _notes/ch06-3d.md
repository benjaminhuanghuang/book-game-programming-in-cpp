## Transform Matrices for 3D
3D coordinates, the translation matrices become 4*4 matrices

## Roation
in 2D an actor only needed one float for rotation about z-axis

3D, it’s valid to rotate about `any` of the three coordinate axes.

One approach for 3D rotations is Euler angles, where there are three angles (yaw, pitch, and
roll) representing rotation about each axis.

Yaw is a rotation about the up axis, 
pitch is a rotation about the side axis, 
and roll is a rotation about the forward axis.


## Quaternions
quaternion as a method to represent a rotation about an arbitrary axis (not just x, y, or z).
为了表示旋转，至少需要 旋转了多少度 和 向哪个方向旋转 
quaternion 由向量和角度构成

unit quaternions, which are quaternions with a magnitude of one


```
  // Scale, then rotate, then translate
  mWorldTransform = Matrix4::CreateScale(mScale);
  mWorldTransform *= Matrix4::CreateFromQuaternion(mRotation);
  mWorldTransform *= Matrix4::CreateTranslation(mPosition);
```
