## Vectors
A mathematical vector (not std::vector) represents both a magnitude
and direction in an n-dimensional space, with one component per dimension. This means that
a two-dimensional (2D) vector has x and y components.

A vector has no concept of a position. 
This means that two vectors are equivalent if they have the `same magnitude and same direction`
